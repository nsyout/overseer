# CORE BUSINESS LOGIC

Business logic layer - orchestrates task operations, validation, context assembly, learning inheritance.

## FILES

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `mod.rs` | - | Module exports |
| `task_service.rs` | 1471 | Task CRUD, validation, cycle detection, depth enforcement |
| `workflow_service.rs` | 1208 | Task lifecycle: start/complete with VCS |
| `context.rs` | 481 | Context chain assembly, learning aggregation |

## KEY ALGORITHMS

### DFS Cycle Detection (task_service.rs:267-301)

**Parent cycles**: Linear traversal up parent chain.
```
current -> parent -> parent.parent -> ... -> task_id? (cycle!)
```

**Blocker cycles**: DFS with visited set.
```
new_blocker -> its blockers -> their blockers -> ... -> task_id? (cycle!)
```
- HashSet for O(1) visited check
- Stack-based iteration (no recursion)
- Early termination on cycle found

### Next Ready Resolution (task_service.rs:434-548)

**`next_ready()`**: DFS to find deepest unblocked leaf
**`resolve_start_target()`**: Follows blockers to find startable work
**`collect_incomplete_leaves()`**: Recursive leaf path collection

### Context Chain Assembly (context.rs:57-83)

**Depth-based inheritance**:
- **Depth 0** (Milestone): own only
- **Depth 1** (Task): own + milestone (parent)
- **Depth 2** (Subtask): own + parent + milestone (grandparent)

### Learnings Bubbling (workflow_service.rs)

On task completion with learnings:
1. Learnings attached to completed task
2. Copy to immediate parent (preserves `source_task_id`)
3. Siblings see learnings after code merges to common ancestor

## PATTERNS

### Service Layer
- `TaskService<'a>` wraps all business logic
- `TaskWorkflowService<'a>` handles VCS-integrated lifecycle
- DB connection passed by reference (&Connection)
- All ops return `Result<T, OsError>`

### Validation Order
1. Existence checks (parent, blockers)
2. Cycle detection (more specific error)
3. Depth limit enforcement
4. DB mutation

### VCS Integration (workflow_service.rs)
- `start()`: VCS required - creates bookmark/branch, records start commit
- `complete_with_learnings()`: VCS required - commits changes (NothingToCommit = success), adds learnings, checkouts start_commit, deletes bookmark/branch (best-effort)
- `complete_milestone_with_learnings()`: Same + deletes ALL descendant bookmarks/branches recursively
- Transaction order: VCS ops first, then DB state update
- **Unified stacking semantics**: Git workflow behavior is consistent across start/complete
  - On complete: checkout `start_commit` → delete bookmark/branch
  - Solves git's "cannot delete checked-out branch" error
- Bookmark cleanup: best-effort deletion, logs warning on failure, clears DB field on success
- Errors: `NotARepository` (no git repo), `DirtyWorkingCopy` (uncommitted changes)
- WorkflowService.new() takes `Box<dyn VcsBackend>` (not Option)

## INVARIANTS

1. MAX_DEPTH = 2 (3 levels: 0, 1, 2)
2. Cycle detection BEFORE depth check
3. Depth always recomputed, never trusted from DB
4. Context chain matches depth semantics exactly
5. Learnings bubble to immediate parent only (preserves source_task_id)
6. VCS required for start/complete - CRUD ops work without VCS
7. VCS cleanup on delete is best-effort (logs warning, doesn't fail)
8. VCS bookmark/branch lifecycle: created on start, deleted on complete, DB field cleared on success
9. Milestone completion cleans ALL descendant bookmarks/branches (depth-1 and depth-2) PLUS milestone's own bookmark
10. Blocker edges preserved on completion (not removed) - readiness computed from blocker's completed state
